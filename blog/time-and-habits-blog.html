      I am trying the Pomodore technique to manage my time. I am also exploring different meditation techniques starting with 10 minutes, first thing after I wake up every morning.

    <p>
      I am using the Headspace meditation app which has a free 10 day trial to start with. It is a good introduction to meditation techniques and is very easy to follow.

      Using Pomodoro technique is helping me to break down bigger tasks into smaller manageable bits and progress in smaller increments.
