      <li style="list-style: none">Emotional intelligence teaches
      us to be calm. It helps us create conditions for our own
      sustainable happiness. As French writer and Buddhist monk
      Matthieu Ricard explains that happiness arises from an
      exceptionally healthy mind and not a mere pleasurable
      feeling, a fleeting emotion or a mood. It is an optimal state
      of being and requires emotional balance alongside a subtle
      understanding of how our minds function. I learned how we all
      have a set point of happiness that we return to whenever the
      euphoria of a pleasant experience or the sting of an
      unpleasant experience fades out. Many of us assume this set
      point to be static, however the opposite is true. The set
      point is movable and can be acheived through proper training.
