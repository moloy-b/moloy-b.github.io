        Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the
        DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical
        friend?
      </p>

    <li style="list-style: none">HTML 'hyper text markup
    language' is a language of the web. It is used to define the
    basic structure and content of a webpage. CSS 'cascading
    style sheets' is a language used to define the style of a
    webpage eg. colours,borders, backgrounds etc. DOM or Document
    Object Model is a language independent convention which
    represents and interacts with the objects in HTML. It helps
    other languages like Javascript and CSS to interact with the
    HTML.

        What is meant by boxifying design?

    <li style="list-style: none">Breaking down the page design
    into multiple boxes which include the header, body, images,
    url's etc. This process is undertaken before one starts
    writing the HTML code and helps in planning the layout of the
    page.

        What is the box model?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">All HTML elements can be
    considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used
    when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is
    essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It
    consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual
    content. Content is the nucleus and sits in the centre.
    Margins, borders and padding surround the actual content.
