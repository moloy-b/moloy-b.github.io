        What is grid based design?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">Our eyes follow a natural pattern of looking
      from left to right and top to bottom. Many websites are designed according
       to this layout and is known as the grid based layout/design. The grid
       based design is controlled by css. Css classes that control the layout
       are called 'frameworks'

        Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">People use multiple devices like desktop
      computers, laptops netbooks, tablets and mobile to access the internet.
      All screens have a different resolution and it is measured in pixels.
      Screens pixel width can range from 1200px to 2560px depending on the
      device. Creating internet content with width of 960px is quite common.
      It not only does fit in the browser (smaller screens) but also can be
      centrally aligned in case of large screen sizes. Thus the website isn't
      fixed with single size and the page will respond and resize correctly to
      make everything look great and legible.

        What is semantic structure?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">Tags that not only make sense to the browser
      but also to the humans looking at them form the semantic structure of a
      page. Headers 1-4 <h1> <h4>, image <img> and form <form> are part of the
      semantic structure.
